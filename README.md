# WP-API Guides
It is apparent that we need some user guides to get people started for the [REST API Handbook](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/). This repository is an effort to collect some helpful user stories.

## Some Guide Ideas
- [ ] Getting Posts using cURL
- [ ] Using PHP to consume the WP-API - examples with grabbing posts from another page, creating a newsfeed
- [ ] Using JS to consume the WP-API - examples with grabbing posts and showing it on a page
- [ ] Using the [wp-api backbone client](https://github.com/WP-API/client-js) to consume the WP-API - examples with grabbing posts and showing it on a page

## Want to help?
Awesome! Feel free to fork this repo and start writing a guide. I will add some formatting rules for the guides shortly. We will be (loosely) following the formatting of the [wp-cli handbook repo](https://github.com/wp-cli/handbook).
